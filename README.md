## About

### CiteSeek is a program developed by MNM Technologies. It utilizes a WinForms GUI and C++ to locate car citations efficiently. This is done through merge sort and quick sort, and the program compares the time taken to sort by both methods.

## Installation

### To utilize CiteSeek, users must download the Microsoft .NET Framework from this link (version 4.7.2): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472

### (Note: this program can only be run from a Windows machine)

### In addition, users must download the latest version of CiteSeek from this GitHub Repository.

### There is no direct .exe for this program that works correctly, so if a demo is needed, please contact the authors.

## Credits 

### (The data set we used was altered by only including the first 8,000 rows (with 13 columns in each row) from the original .CSV file https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/parking_citations/ to cut down on execution time)

### Citations for code can be found in main.cpp
