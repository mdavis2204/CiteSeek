## About

### CiteSeek is a program developed by MNM Technologies. It utilizes a WinForms GUI and C++ to locate car citations efficiently. This is done through merge sort and quick sort, and the program compares the time taken to sort by both methods. (The data set we used was altered by deleting the last 48 entries from the original .CSV file to not include parking citations with negative fine amounts and is included in the Project3 folder.)

## Installation

### To utilize CiteSeek, users must download the Microsoft .NET Framework from this link (version 4.7.2): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472

### (Note: this program can only be run from a Windows machine)

### In addition, users must download the latest version of CiteSeek from this GitHub Repository.

## Once these steps have been completed, simply run the .exe and enjoy searching!

## Credits 

### Citations for code can be found in main.cpp
