## About

### CiteSeek is a program developed by MNM Technologies. It utilizes a WinForms GUI and C++ to locate car citations efficiently. This is done through merge sort and quick sort, and the program compares the time taken to sort by both methods. (The data set we used was altered by only including the first 8,000 rows (with 13 columns in each row) from the original .CSV file https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/parking_citations/ to cut down on execution time)

## Installation

### To utilize CiteSeek, users must download the Microsoft .NET Framework from this link (version 4.7.2): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472

### (Note: this program can only be run from a Windows machine)

### In addition, users must download the latest version of CiteSeek from this GitHub Repository.

## Once these steps have been completed, simply run the .exe and enjoy searching!

## Credits 

### Citations for code can be found in main.cpp
